# Closed points of group schemes

This file relates the group of rational points of a finite-type group scheme
over an algebraically closed field to its closed points. It also restricts
inversion and left translation to homeomorphisms of the closed-point subspace.

No topological-group structure is asserted: continuity of scheme-theoretic
multiplication uses the scheme-product topology, which need not be the ordinary
product topology on the closed-point spaces.
